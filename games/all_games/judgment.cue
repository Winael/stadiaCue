Haunted by his past, he takes up arms as a private detective, clawing his way through Kamurochoâ€™s underground crime network to investigate a string of grisly murders. Track suspects, discover clues, and bring evidence to court - but be careful, there are dark characters at every turn. Take advantage of two unique battle styles to take down adversaries in electrifying encounters. Packed with Hollywood-worthy combat sequences and cinematic twists and turns, this mystery will surely keep you on your toes.
